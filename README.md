# NAME

Blockchain::Ethereum - A Ethereum toolkit in Perl

# VERSION

version 0.019

# DESCRIPTION

A Ethereum toolkit written in Perl, combining core utilities for working with Ethereum's internal data structures.

This distribution merges the functionality of previously separate modules into a single toolkit, including:

- ABI encoding and decoding
- RLP serialization
- Transaction creation and signing

These modules are now bundled together in a single distribution to simplify usage, packaging, and long-term maintenance.
